# Prepare an AWS Account for the CGDevX Platform

Welcome to the guide on preparing an AWS account to run CGDevX clusters! This guide will walk you through the necessary steps to set up your AWS account and configure it for running CGDevX on AWS. By following these instructions, you'll be ready to leverage the power of CGDevX in your AWS environment.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- An AWS account with administrative privileges
- Basic knowledge of AWS services and concepts
- Access to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/)

## Step 1: Creating IAM User and Role

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console using your AWS account credentials.
2. Open the IAM service.
3. Create a new IAM user for CGDevX with programmatic access.
4. Attach the necessary policies to the IAM user. These policies should include permissions such as:
   - [AmazonEC2FullAccess](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEC2FullAccess)
   - [AmazonRoute53FullAccess](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonRoute53FullAccess)
   - [AmazonVPCFullAccess](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonVPCFullAccess)
5. Generate and save the IAM user's access key ID and secret access key.

## Step 2: Creating AWS VPC

1. Open the [Amazon VPC](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/) service in the AWS Management Console.
2. Create a new Amazon VPC with appropriate CIDR blocks for your CGDevX clusters.
3. Configure subnets within the VPC, including public and private subnets.

## Step 3: Configuring Security Groups

1. Navigate to the [Amazon VPC](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/) service in the AWS Management Console.
2. Create security groups for your CGDevX clusters, allowing necessary inbound and outbound traffic.

## Step 4: Setting Up AWS CLI

1. Install the [AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) on your local machine.
2. Configure the AWS CLI with the access key ID and secret access key of the IAM user created earlier.

## Step 5: Verifying AWS Account Setup

1. Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.
2. Run the following AWS CLI command to verify your account setup:
   ```
   aws ec2 describe-vpcs
   ```
   This command should return information about the VPCs in your AWS account.

## Conclusion

You have successfully prepared your AWS account to run CGDevX clusters! With your IAM user, VPC, security groups, and AWS CLI configured you're ready to deploy and manage CGDevX clusters in your AWS environment.
