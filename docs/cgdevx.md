# CloudGeometry Development Excellence

When choosing the technology that runs your architecture, it's crucial to understand not only whether it integrates well
with your existing components, but also whether it will support your business in the long term. If you get it wrong,
you'll need to make changes to fix it, including modernizing outdated technologies. Additionally, the cost of re-tooling
or re-platforming grows with the size of the organization, so the larger your organization is (or is expected to
become), the more important these choices become.

CG DevX's goal is to be a framework and test playground, simplifying the adoption of open-source technology and
providing it in a pre-configured and pre-integrated form. At the same time, it comes in a production-ready configuration
that can be easily extended to not only make necessary remediations but also to meet compliance or security regulations,
thus reducing the risks of compatibility issues when building an Internal Developer Platform.

Scenarios where CG DevX can be used include, but are not limited to:

- Bootstrapping Platform Engineering efforts to achieve level 2â€“3 in the CNCF platform engineering maturity model
- Modernizing existing infrastructure and runtime
- Fostering cloud adoption
- Serving as a set of templates when implementing the functionality of any CG DevX modules or their parts

CG DevX is:

- **Open Source-centric**: We prioritize open source over proprietary components when building functionality modules.
- **Self-contained**: All components of the platform are inside Kubernetes to enable platform portability, so you can
  run it on any K8s flavor, virtualized or bare metal.
- **Feedback and community-driven**: The initial version of CG DevX was built based on feedback from engineering teams.
- **Standardized but customizable**: We provide a set of guidelines that can be further extended and enforced based on
  specific requirements. Developers and operators can decide whether to follow these guidelines.
- **Technology enabler**: We offer a pre-configured set of tools that enable technical capabilities. Practices and
  processes on top of them are out of CG DevX's scope.
