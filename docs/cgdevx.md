# CloudGeometry Development Excellence

When adopting Open Source as part of the platform, there is a challenge
of choosing technology that should support business long-term.
When picking a specific piece of technology is crucial to understand if it plays well with other components. Wrong
choices or outdated technologies should be modernized,
and the cost of re-tooling or re-platforming growth with the same of the organization.

CG DevX goal is to be a framework and test playground,
simplifying adoption of Open Source technology, providing it in a pre-configured and pre-integrated form.
At the same time, it comes in a production ready configuration
that could be easily extended to meet compliance or security regulations.
Thus reducing the risks of compatibility issues when building Internal Developer Platform.

CG DevX could be used in the following scenarios but is not limited to:

- Bootstrapping Platform Engineering efforts to achieve level 2â€“3 in CNCF platform engineering maturity model;
- Modernize existing infrastructure and runtime;
- Foster cloud adoption;
- As a set of templates when implementing the functionality of any CG DevX modules or their parts.

CG DevX is:

- **Open Source centric**: we will prioritise open source over any proprietary components when building functionality
  modules.
- **Self-contained**: we deliberately put all the components of the platform inside Kubernetes to enable platform
  portability, so you could run it on any K8s flavor, virtualized or bare metal.
- **Feedback and community driven**: we build the initial version of CG DevX based on feedback of engineering teams.
- **Standardized but customizable**: we provide a set of guidelines that could be further extended and enforced based on
  specific requirements it's up to developers and operators on whether they will follow them or not.
- **Technology enabler**: we offer a pre-configured set of tools that enable technical capabilities. Practices and
  processes on top of them are out of CG DevX scope.
