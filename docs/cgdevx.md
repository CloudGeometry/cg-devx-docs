# CloudGeometry Development Excellence

When adopting Open Source as part of the platform, there is a challenge
to choosing technology that should support the business long-term.
When picking a specific piece of technology it is crucial to understand if it plays well with other components. Incorrect
choices must be fixed, and outdated technologies should be modernized,
and the cost of re-tooling or re-platforming grows with the size of the organization.

CG DevX's goal is to be a framework and test playground,
simplifying adoption of Open Source technology and providing it in a pre-configured and pre-integrated form.
At the same time, it comes in a production-ready configuration
that can be easily extended to meet compliance or security regulations, thus reducing the risks of compatibility issues when building an Internal Developer Platform.

Scenarios where CG DevX can be used include, but are not limited to:

- Bootstrapping Platform Engineering efforts to achieve level 2â€“3 in the CNCF platform engineering maturity model;
- Modernizing existing infrastructure and runtime;
- Fostering cloud adoption;
- As a set of templates when implementing the functionality of any CG DevX modules or their parts.

CG DevX is:

- **Open Source-centric**: We will prioritise open source over any proprietary components when building functionality
  modules.
- **Self-contained**: We deliberately put all the components of the platform inside Kubernetes to enable platform
  portability, so you can run it on any K8s flavor, virtualized or bare metal.
- **Feedback and community driven**: We built the initial version of CG DevX based on feedback from engineering teams.
- **Standardized but customizable**: We provide a set of guidelines that can be further extended and enforced based on
  specific requirements; it's up to developers and operators to decide whether they will follow them or not.
- **Technology enabler**: We offer a pre-configured set of tools that enables technical capabilities. Practices and
  processes on top of them are out of CG DevX's scope.
