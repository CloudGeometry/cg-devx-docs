# Alertmanager: Effortless Alert Handling 

In CG DevX, we understand the criticality of handling alerts from client applications like the Prometheus server effectively. To streamline this process, we rely on Alertmanager, which excels at de-duplicating, grouping, and routing alerts to their designated receiver integrations, such as email, Slack, MS Teams, or OpsGenie. Additionally, Alertmanager takes charge of silencing and inhibiting alerts when necessary, ensuring a smooth and organized alerting experience.

### Configuration Made Simple

Alertmanager in CG DevX is pre-configured to use global values found under 'settings' alerts and co-monitoring. This out-of-the-box configuration ensures that your alerts are appropriately managed without requiring extensive setup.

### Empowering Teams with Customization

We believe in empowering our teams to tailor their alerting experience according to their specific needs. Thus, any team within CG DevX has the option to override some or all global configurations. This capability allows teams to have alerts sent directly to their own designated endpoints, ensuring alerts reach the right people for prompt action.

### Self-Service Alerting for Seamless Operations

At CG DevX, we prioritize user experience and efficiency. With this in mind, self-service rights for alerting are enabled by default for all teams. This means teams can effortlessly manage their alerting preferences without unnecessary red tape.

### Multi-Tenant Mode Excellence

In scenarios where CG DevX operates in multi-tenant mode, each team receives a dedicated Alertmanager instance. This ensures that teams can work in isolation, focusing solely on their specific alerting needs without any interference from other teams.
