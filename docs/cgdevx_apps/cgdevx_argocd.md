# ArgoCD: Your GitOps Continuous Delivery Solution

ArgoCD presents a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool designed exclusively for Kubernetes. ArgoCD is seamlessly integrated with CGDevX, leveraging the capabilities of Vault for Single Sign-On (SSO), streamlining access control while ensuring a seamless user experience.

### Effortless Access Control with CGDevX and Vault Integration

As a CGDevX user, you'll enjoy the smooth integration of ArgoCD with Vault for SSO, making authentication and authorization a breeze. Let's explore how CGDevX maps groups to ArgoCD roles:

1. **Elevate Your Capabilities: The Super Admin Role**
   Within ArgoCD, the super admin role is granted to the designated CGDevX administrators. This ensures comprehensive access and control over ArgoCD operations.

2. **Streamlined Team Management: The Team-Admin Role**
   In ArgoCD, the team-admin role holds significant importance. CGDevX team admins are equipped with admin access to all team projects, simplifying team-level management.

3. **Independence for Team Members: Managing Own Projects**
   ArgoCD's configuration allocates team members to their individual project repositories, empowering them to govern their projects independently.

### Simplified Workflow: From Repository to Automation

ArgoCD, in harmony with CGDevX, automates the Git repository management process, streamlining continuous delivery:

1. **Automated Git Repository Generation**
   Upon team establishment, ArgoCD promptly creates a dedicated Git repository in Gitea, uniquely identified as `team-$teamId-argocd`. This repository is purpose-built to cater to the team's needs.

2. **Effortless Repository Access and Synchronization**
   ArgoCD takes care of repository access configuration, ensuring seamless synchronization of applications with the intended state described in the repository.

3. **Collaborate with Ease**
   The team-admin, or any member with self-service rights, simply needs to fill the repository with the desired configurations and commit the changes. ArgoCD's automation handles the rest, streamlining collaboration and delivery.

With ArgoCD and CGDevX, your team can fully focus on innovation and development, leaving deployment and continuous delivery in the capable hands of the pipeline.
