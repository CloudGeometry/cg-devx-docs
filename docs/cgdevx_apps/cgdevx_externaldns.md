# External-DNS: Seamlessly Manage Your Service Domains

In CG DevX, we strive to provide a hassle-free experience when it comes to making your public service domains accessible. To achieve this, we utilize External-DNS, an essential tool that registers your service domains with CG DevX's front load balancer CNAME or IP address. This ensures that your services are readily available to users without any unnecessary complications.

### The Power of External-DNS

External-DNS serves as a vital component in managing your service domains effectively. By enabling External-DNS, you can take full control of your domain registrations, allowing you to tailor the accessibility of your services precisely as needed.

### nip.io as a Fallback

In cases where External-DNS is not enabled (which is the default setting), we leverage nip.io, a powerful tool that automatically generates hostnames for all your services. This fallback option ensures that even without External-DNS, your services remain reachable, and you can carry on with your operations without interruptions.

### Unlocking Powerful Features

Enabling External-DNS unlocks a world of possibilities within CG DevX. Specifically, it's a prerequisite for utilizing the following features:

1. Harbor Private Registries for Teams: Take advantage of Harbor's robust private registries to securely store and manage your container images. With External-DNS enabled, you can seamlessly integrate Harbor into your workflows, ensuring a smooth and secure container registry experience.

3. Projects (Supported by Harbor): Leverage the full potential of projects within CG DevX by harnessing the capabilities of Harbor, backed by External-DNS. This combination empowers you to manage your projects effortlessly and ensures optimal project outcomes.
