# Grafana: Visualize Prometheus Metrics and Loki Logs

CGDevX empowers teams to leverage the full potential of Grafana, a powerful platform for visualizing Prometheus metrics and Loki logs. With seamless integration, CGDevX streamlines access control and ensures a smooth experience for both team members and admins.

### Effortless Access Control: Team Members and Admins

In CGDevX, we understand the importance of access control in collaborative environments. To simplify team operations, we have established the following roles:

1. **Editor Role for Team Members**
   Team members are automatically granted the Editor role in Grafana. This role equips them with the necessary privileges to visualize and interact with metrics and logs effectively.

2. **Admin Role for Administrators**
   Administrators hold a pivotal role in managing the system. In Grafana, they are bestowed with the Admin role, providing them with comprehensive control over configurations and settings.

### Empowering Direct Configuration Changes

To expedite workflows and foster flexibility, CGDevX allows certain direct configuration changes within Grafana. However, these changes are limited to non-conflicting settings to ensure the stability and consistency of the system. Data sources are preconfigured and must not be edited as changes will be lost when Grafana is redeployed.

### Preconfigured Data Sources: A Solid Foundation

In CGDevX's Grafana integration, data sources are thoughtfully preconfigured to eliminate unnecessary complexities. These data sources are meticulously set up to seamlessly interact with Prometheus metrics and Loki logs.

We recommend refraining from editing these preconfigured data sources, as any changes made to them will be lost during Grafana's redeployment. Embrace the simplicity and stability of the preconfigured data sources and focus on visualizing your metrics and logs without unnecessary overhead.

### Embrace the Full Potential of Grafana with CGDevX

CGDevX presents a user-friendly and powerful environment for utilizing Grafana to its fullest. Visualize Prometheus metrics and Loki logs with ease while enjoying streamlined access control and preconfigured data sources.
