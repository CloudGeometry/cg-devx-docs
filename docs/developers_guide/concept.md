The goal of CG DevX is to improve developer productivity by enhancing the developer experience. One of the biggest challenges in a modern cloud-native environment is the constantly increasing cognitive load.

Working with microservice architectures in a cloud-native setup often requires end-to-end knowledge of Kubernetes (K8s), infrastructure provisioning, deployment pipelines, and configuration management.

CG DevX provides layers of abstraction to simplify day-to-day tasks for developers. CG DevX:

- Hides complexity associated with the shift-left paradigm and enables a PaaS-like experience:
  - K8s manifests and configuration management are simplified with pre-built templates and code generation.
  - IaC management is limited to application-specific resources only and covered by ready-to-use templates; cloud complexity is abstracted away by GitOps.
- Implements security scanning and testing at early stages of the pipeline, enabling developers to accommodate security feedback faster.
- Reduces operational friction in CI/CD with better outcomes:
  - Working pipelines out of the box.
  - Well-defined extension points.
  - Automated rollbacks.
- Provides observability and log management out of the box:
  - Automated discovery.
  - Pre-built dashboards.
