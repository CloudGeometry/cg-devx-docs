CG DevX goal is to improve developer productivity through improving the developer experience. 
One of the biggest challenges in a modern cloud-native environment is a constantly increasing cognitive load. 
 
Working with microservice architectures in a cloud-native setup often requires end-to-end knowledge of K8s, infrastructure provisioning, deployment pipelines, and configuration management.

CG DevX provides layers of abstractions to simplify day-to-day tasks for Developers.

- Hides complexity associated with shift-left paradigm and enables PaaS-like experience:
    - K8s manifests and configuration management reduced with pre-built templates and codegen
    - IaC management is limited to application specific resources only and covered by ready to use templates cloud
      complexity is abstracted away by GitOps
- Implementing security scanning and testing at early stages of pipeline enables developers to accommodate security
  feedback faster
- Reduces the operation friction in CI/CD with better outcomes:
  - working pipelines out of the box
  - well-defined extensions points
  - automated rollbacks
- Provides observability and log management out of the box:
    - automated discovery
    - pre-build dashboards
