The goal of CG DevX is to improve developer productivity through improving the developer experience. 
One of the biggest challenges in a modern cloud-native environment is a constantly increasing cognitive load. 
 
Working with microservice architectures in a cloud-native setup often requires end-to-end knowledge of K8s, infrastructure provisioning, deployment pipelines, and configuration management.

CG DevX provides layers of abstractions to simplify day-to-day tasks for developers. CG DevX:

- Hides complexity associated with the shift-left paradigm and enables a PaaS-like experience:
    - K8s manifests and configuration management are reduced with pre-built templates and code generation
    - IaC management is limited to application-specific resources only and covered by ready-to-use templates; cloud
      complexity is abstracted away by GitOps
- Implementing security scanning and testing at early stages of pipeline enables developers to accommodate security
  feedback faster
&nbsp;  
- Reduces the operational friction in CI/CD with better outcomes:
    - Working pipelines out of the box
    - Well-defined extension points
    - Automated rollbacks
- Provides observability and log management out of the box:
    - Automated discovery
    - Pre-build dashboards
