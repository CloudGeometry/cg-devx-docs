# Welcome to CG DevX

`cg-devx` is a Platform Engineering toolkit designed to improve software delivery outcomes by introducing consistency, automation, and engineering discipline into the application lifecycle.

## Why It Matters

DevOps helped close the gap between developers and operations, but it often led to fragmented tooling and inconsistent workflows. As organizations scale, this approach struggles to ensure security, compliance, and repeatability.

Platform Engineering builds on the principles of DevOps but formalizes them into structured, reusable systems. With `cg-devx`, teams adopt shared standards for delivery, reduce variation across environments, and scale developer productivity without sacrificing governance.

## What is `cg-devx`?

`cg-devx` enables internal platform teams to provide developers with a curated, reliable application delivery experience. It combines:

- **Golden Paths**: Pre-defined, production-ready workflows for new services
- **GitOps Automation**: Declarative infrastructure and application delivery
- **Scaffold-as-Code**: Service bootstrapping with integrated pipelines, observability, and policies

## Key Benefits

- Standardizes onboarding for application teams
- Encodes delivery best practices into platform services
- Enables secure, repeatable delivery at scale

`cg-devx` supports organizations transitioning from DevOps culture to formalized platform engineering practice, making delivery more predictable, governed, and scalable.

# The `cgdevx` Toolkit

`cgdevx` provides the foundational tooling for platform teams to build and maintain Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) that scale delivery discipline across organizations.

## Why Use `cgdevx`?

Software delivery often starts with informal scripts and manual pipelines. As systems grow, these approaches become hard to scale, audit, or govern.

`cgdevx` introduces structure and versioning into delivery workflows, turning best practices into reusable, sharable assets.

## Toolkit Capabilities

### Scaffold-as-Code

Standardized scaffolding ensures new services begin with compliant and production-ready defaults:

- CI/CD pipelines
- Linting and testing frameworks
- Observability configuration
- Security policies and deployment gates

### Golden Paths

Golden Paths encode curated delivery workflows that are:

- Reproducible across environments
- Aligned with security and compliance policies
- Version-controlled for traceability

### GitOps Automation

`cgdevx` integrates with GitOps controllers to:

- Enforce infrastructure immutability
- Enable declarative, rollback-friendly deployments
- Support policy-as-code enforcement across environments

## Supporting Delivery Contracts

The toolkit enables platform teams to define and enforce delivery contracts â€” shared agreements encoded as code, ensuring application teams can move quickly without bypassing compliance and security.
