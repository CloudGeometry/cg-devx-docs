# User management

CG DevX manages users using a module defined in `/terraform/users/main.tf`.

By default, a CG DevX installation will have one admin level machine user named `CG DEVX-bot`.
You can create additional users by editing the `users` variable that has the following structure:

```hcl
users            = {
    "<user_name>" = {
      vcs_username         = "Git user name"
      email                = "User email"
      first_name           = "User first name"
      last_name            = "User last name"
      # Git team slugs generated by VCS module, e.g.
      vcs_team_slugs       = ["${local.gitops_repo_name}-admins", "<workload>-maintainers"]
      # ACL policies, e.g. 
      acl_policies         = ["admin", "developers", "default", "<workload>-admins"]
      # OIDC access group, e.g.
      oidc_groups_for_user = ["admins", "developers", "<workload>-admins"]
    },
}
```
