# Workload Environments

A workload may have multiple stages/environments or instances of a workload with its associated configuration and resources.

Delivery pipelines automatically roll out changes to all stages except live environments, which are usually user-facing environments such as production, and by default, require manual promotion.

Each new workload has three environments (dev, sta, prod) with three different environment variants (dev, uat, prod) associated with it, where one (prod) is the "live" environment.

Optionally, itâ€™s possible to create a temporary environment (also known as an ephemeral environment) associated with a specific feature branch, with the environment lifecycle tied to the branch lifecycle. This can be used for feature testing in isolation or User Acceptance Testing (UAT).

An environment can be associated with a specific CG DevX Runtime cluster (K8s cluster).
