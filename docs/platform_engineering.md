## From DevOps to Platform Engineering

DevOps emerged to bridge the gap between developers and operations. While effective in fostering collaboration, it often resulted in team-specific tooling, tribal knowledge, and a lack of delivery standardization.

As delivery complexity increases, this model becomes brittle. Platform Engineering addresses these limitations by introducing shared infrastructure, governance, and delivery contracts that ensure consistency and compliance across teams.

## Platform Engineering as Engineering Discipline

At its core, Platform Engineering is about applying engineering rigor to internal tools and services:

- **Version-controlled delivery workflows**
- **Reusable infrastructure modules**
- **Defined interface contracts between teams**
- **Observability and policy enforcement as defaults**

Rather than relying on informal practices, platform teams build services that encode delivery best practices as productized capabilities.

## Why Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) Matter

IDPs created via Platform Engineering empower developers while enforcing guardrails. They simplify workflows, reduce cognitive overhead, and ensure that delivery pipelines meet organizational standards â€” by design, not convention.

## Outcomes You Can Expect

- Increased release velocity with fewer regressions
- Built-in compliance through delivery standardization
- Lower onboarding costs for new services and teams
