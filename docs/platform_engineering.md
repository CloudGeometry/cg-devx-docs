Platform engineering is a new discipline that emerged in response to the growing complexity of modern cloud-native
architectures. It describes the practice of building and maintaining an integrated product, called an "Internal
Developer Platform," which acts as a flexible and supported abstraction layer between developers and the underlying
technologies of their applications.

The goal of platform engineering is to improve developer productivity through improving the developer experience (
DevEx).

Internal developer platforms improve the velocity and happiness of teams by enabling developer self-service and reducing
cognitive load on developers.

Core benefits of Platform Engineering and Internal Developer Platforms:

- **Faster innovation**: Faster time to launch, frequent updates, focus on business problems
- **Higher quality**: Fewer environment issues, more deterministic test results, faster rollback
- **Increased reliability**: Observable services, graceful degradation, improved business continuity, optimisation for a
  fluctuating load
- **Improved security**: Reduced security engineering overhead, Improved security
  operations and governance
- **Improved ways of working**: Define policy via experimentation and simpler processes, apply enabling constraints,
  zero downtime updates
- **Reduced costs**: Economies of scale, easier cost management
- **Better productivity**: Lower cognitive load, easier to identify talent needs

Platform Engineering and the Internal Developer Platform is:

- **Not a commodity**: It cannot be bought off the shelf, as it must satisfy the specific needs of your organisation.
  It’s
  built by weaving together open-source and bespoke commodity tools to create a technology accelerator.
- **Not a project**: It isn’t a one-off development with a fixed end date. It will keep changing, as the needs of your
  teams will change based on their customers’ demands.
- **Not a universal infrastructure platform**: It cannot run all cloud services for all possible consumers. It needs to
  focus on a subset of cloud services to support specific workloads.

It’s important to remember that an Internal Developer Platform isn’t a silver bullet. It’s a long-term commitment to
providing Services at scale.
It’s not appropriate for all workloads, teams, or organizations.
